we found the "INBOX" in vol_vol9/home/wh1t3r0s3/.thunderbird/r83d37ln.default/ImapMail/imap.gmail.com. And the email address "illini.pony.express@gmail.com" can be found in the file. We also found a link https://goo.gl/6eIjx1 which leads us to a webpage. It told us to concat "goo.gl/" with the contents in code.txt. We then download a file named "tickets.png". We can not open the file. So we use the command "$file ticket.png" and found out that the file format is actually pdf. We changed the file name to "ticket.pdf" and we can see the tickets.
