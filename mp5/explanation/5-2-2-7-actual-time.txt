We found that the suspect didn't see the email, since the email is in the trash can. We found the file "Trash" in /vol_vol9/home/wh1t3r0s3/.thunderbird/r83d37ln.default/ImapMail/imap.gmail.com/[Gmail].sbd. The link for "ticket.pdf" can be found there. However, the "modified time", "change time", and "access time" are all 2015-11-11, which is too late. The ticket is for 2015-11-04. We've also searched for the keywork "6eIjx1" in autopsy, it includes all the email that gives the "tickets.pdf" to the suspect. Nevertheless, all the files are modified, changed, and accessed on 2015-11-11. So we thought that the suspect didn't get on the illini pony express.
