1.
We thought that the suspect is not the murderer. She searched for toxic waste hazardously sour candy, which is an extremely sour candy (but not poison) (ps:we have googled it). So it is impossible that she used this kind of candy to poison the victim.
2.
She might just be a normal girl friend who is envious that her boyfriend went out with Alice. What's more, she didn't git the ticket on time.
3.
She is very worry about the victim and sent a lot of message to him even if he didn't respond at all. So she is not going to harm him.
4.
She may be a criminal justice or chemistry student who loves to search for some toxidant.
5.
Even if she wants to kill, she may want to kill Alice. Ladiesman461 is her boyfriend, so she is not going to kill her boyfriend
